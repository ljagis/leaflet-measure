# leaflet-measure

Coordinate, linear, and area measure control for [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) maps. Extends [L.Control](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control).

## [Demo](http://ljagis.github.io/leaflet-measure)

## Installation
Install with NPM:

`npm install leaflet-measure` or `npm install leaflet-measure --save`

Angular users add `"node_modules/leaflet-measure/dist/leaflet-measure.css"` in the `angular.json` and import it in your component `import 'leaflet-measure';`

## Usage

TODO. Add usage


## Add control to a Leaflet map

`leaflet-measure` adds `L.Control.Measure`. This control may be used with the standard Leaflet control workflows [described in the Leaflet docs](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control).

The measure control can be instantiated directly and added to a map:
```javascript
var myMap = L.map('mapElementId', options);
var measureControl = new L.Control.Measure(options);
measureControl.addTo(myMap);
```

or instantiated via the factory:
```javascript
var myMap = L.map('mapElementId', options);
var measureControl = L.control.measure(options);
measureControl.addTo(myMap);
```

or added to a map using map options:
```javascript
var myMap = L.map('mapElementId', {
  measureControl: true
});
```

## Control options

### position

`{ position: 'topright' }`

Standard Leaflet control [position options](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control-positions)

### primaryLengthUnit | secondaryLengthUnit

`{ primaryLengthUnit: 'feet', secondaryLengthUnit: 'miles' }`

Units used to display length results. `secondaryLengthUnit` is optional.

Valid values are `feet`, `meters`, `miles`, and `kilometers`

### primaryAreaUnit | secondaryAreaUnit

`{ primaryAreaUnit: 'acres', secondaryAreaUnit: undefined }`

Units used to display area results. `secondaryAreaUnit` is optional.

Valid values are `acres`, `hectares`, `sqfeet`, `sqmeters`, and `sqmiles`

### activeColor

`{ activeColor: '#ABE67E' }`

Base color to use for map features rendered while actively performing a measurement. Value should be a color represented as a hexadecimal string.

### completedColor

`{ completedColor: '#C8F2BE' }`

Base color to use for features generated from a completed measurement. Value should be a color represented as a hexadecimal string.

### popupOptions

`popupOptions: { className: 'leaflet-measure-resultpopup', autoPanPadding: [10, 10] }`

Options applied to the popup of the resulting measure feature. Properties may be any standard Leaflet [popup options](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#popup-options).

### units

Custom units to make available to the measurement calculator. Packaged units are `feet`, `meters`, `miles`, and `kilometers` for length and `acres`, `hectares`, `sqfeet`, `sqmeters`, and `sqmiles` for areas. Additional unit definitions can be added to the packaged units using this option.

Define units as

```javascript
{
  someNewUnit: {
    factor: 0.001, // Required. Factor to apply when converting to this unit. Length in meters or area in sq meters will be multiplied by this factor.
    display: 'My New Unit', // Required. How to display in results, like.. "300 Meters (0.3 My New Unit)".
    decimals: 2 // Number of decimals to round results when using this unit. `0` is the default value if not specified.
  },
  myOtherNewUnit: {
    factor: 1234,
    display: 'My Other Unit',
    decimals: 0
  }
}
```

### captureZIndex

`{ captureZIndex: 10000 }`

Z-index of the marker used to capture measure clicks. Set this value higher than the z-index of all other map layers to disable click events on other layers while a measurement is active.

### decPoint | thousandsSep

`{ decPoint: '.', thousandsSep: ',' }`

Decimal point and thousands separator used when displaying measurements. If not specified, values are defined by the localization.

## Events

You can subscribe to the following events on the [Map](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#map-class) using [these methods](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#events)

### measurestart

Fired when measurement starts

### measurefinish

Fired when measurement finishes with results of the measurement. Results data includes:

- `area`: Area of a polygon measurement in sq meters. 0 for measurements with less than 3 points.

- `areaDisplay`: Area formatted as displayed in the popup.

- `lastCoord`: Last point clicked in both decimal degrees and degress/min/seconds.

- `length`: Length of the measurement in meters. 0 for measurements with less than 2 points.

- `lengthDisplay`: Length formatted as displayed in the popup.

- `pointCount`: Number of points directly added by the user.

- `points`: Array of points as [`LatLng`](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#latlng) used to calculate the measurement. Number of items in the array may differ from `pointCoint` because an additional point is added to close polygons during polygon measurements.

## Customizing map feature styles

Map features may be styled using CSS SVG style attributes. Features generated from `leaflet-measure` measurements are given the following class names:

- **layer-measurearea**: Feature displaying area of an active measurement

- **layer-measureboundary**: Feature displaying the linear path of an active measurement

- **layer-measurevertex**: Feature added at each vertex (measurement click) of an active measurement

- **layer-measuredrag**: Symbol following cursor while moving during an active measurement

- **layer-measure-resultarea**: Feature added to the map as a permanent layer resulting from an area (3+ points) measurement

- **layer-measure-resultline**: Feature added to the map as a permanent layer resulting from a linear (2 point) measurement

- **layer-measure-resultpoint**: Featured added to the map as a permanent layer resulting from a point (single click) measurement

## Development

The build process uses npm (Node Package Management) which comes with Node.js.

After you have Node.js installed you can do ```npm install``` to install dependencies and ```npm run-script start:dev``` to initialize a local server (localhost:8080) for leaflet-measure assets.

It detects modifications on source files and re-compiles to /leaflet-measure.css and /leaflet-measure.js.

## Distribuition Build

With npm installed do ```npm install``` to install dependencies and ```npm run-script build``` to generate dist/leaflet-measure.css and dist/leaflet-measure.js.

It will also generate dist/leaflet-measure.{locale}.js files for each localization available.
